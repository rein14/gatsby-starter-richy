`Learning to code isn't easy`. On my journey to becoming a software developer, i've had my first share of ups and downs. Roadblocks that your computer science class wouldn't teach you to brace for. I wasn't always confident in my self but with some little work i've thought myself to take things a step at a time. 

Overtime, I've had people ask me how they can become a software developer. And my answer each and everytime is `read and practice simoultenoulsy`,`all the time.` You have to practice to the point where you feel confident enough to move on to the next step. Even ninja engineers still go over the basics from time to time. 

`You dont have to know everything` in the software space to become a developer. Most people perceive software engineers as all knowing, and I do that find that very funny. Remember when i told you to practice, yeah, well so do season developers. Ninja coders/developers are always skimming through official documentations, books and always looking up code online. You definetly cannot put everything into your head, so prepare your mind to accept the fact that throughout your entire software career you will be looking up peoples code, skimmming through books for answers and most probably copy other peoples code.

Prepare to `Sacrifice`. If you truly want to become a software developer, then you will have to cut back on somethings you previously did and most definetly do now in order to suceed as a professional software developer. Because now, you will be locked inside your mind trying to do things most humans would not attempt to do in their right mind do, solving problems most humans did not even know existed. So prepare to sacrifice friends, your current occupation(if you want swich careers), entertainment( `Oh yeah!` `writing code itself is entertaining`). 

`So chill!` becoming a software engineer can be daunting. Eventually you will put the pieces all together and you will start to figure things out as you move ahead.
