Fun fact, i hate video tutorials.
Reading books is one of the best ways to improve your craftsmanship and to become a better software engineer. This is a continuously updated list with my favourite programming books.Most of the books listed below are free to download but you should try as much possible to buy them at least, if you can.

###Self developement 
Books about business, general conduct and discpline

How to build reliable software that works well.

```

###Programming Languages

Books about specific programming languages that I enjoyed. There’s often free resources available online but sometimes it’s nice to just buy a book that takes you through many aspects of a language. Some of these books are great reads even if you’re not interested in the language specifically, as they teach you important universal concepts.
