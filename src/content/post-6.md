Work is great. But working out of location is much better. Working remotely is totally different from working in a four wall office. I don't think you completely grasp the difference until you really start working remote. For someone like me who never worked in a remote setting, obviously the start wouldnâ€™t be smooth and many challenges will come along. But when the dust settled, I got better. 

I'll explain;

**Setting your own work hours;** I can work in my underwear if I want, yeah you heard right. I can work till 3 am and then take the whole day off. I always strive to impress my clients, but I get shit done in my own way. Some days that means working 3 hours. Some days I forget to keep track of time (those days are awesome and shitty at the same time). Actually, the best benefit I find for me here, is, my powenaps. Afternoon powernaps, to me is the best time to think over things in your sleep.

**You won't have a commute,** except when there is an in person meeting, perhaps.  You'll have the comforts of home at your disposal. You'll need to guard against too much distraction, but programming has a way of keeping your head in the game when you're deep in your work. You might very well work overtime just because it interests you, or you realize it's all in your head and you'd rather not have to piece together the puzzle again later. 

Not commuting can **negatively impact** you as a remote developer as well. Lack of movement and isolation, you rarely meet people, always couped up in one corner of your room fixing stuff takes a toll on you sometimes. Most of us are introverts, so it should not be a big deal, but we still need to meet people. Go out for some meet ups, have a hobby that you share with friends, etc. All in all, you work remotely so your schedule is flexible enough to make everything fit. 

**Communication;** It's critical to remember that regardless of whether you are working remote, you should communicate with whoever you are working for. This is a great thing since it places an attention on building joint effort into day-to-day processes.

If you are thinking about remote work, the most productive way you can do it is to implement a **daily routine** for yourself. Test the waters, see what works best for you. If works for you, go for it.
