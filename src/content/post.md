###Trying running " import this" in your python interpreter.

The creators of the python language, unlike any other language sat down and came with a set of rules which every python developer or the python community must follow. They are guidelines to help every developer write more readable and understanderble code. Think of it as the "19 Pythonista Commandment".
```
import this
The Zen of Python, by Tim Peters

Beautiful is better than ugly.
Explicit is better than implicit.
Simple is better than complex.
Complex is better than complicated.
Flat is better than nested.
Sparse is better than dense.
Readability counts.
Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules.
Although practicality beats purity.
Errors should never pass silently.
Unless explicitly silenced.
In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.
There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.
Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch.
Now is better than never.
Although never is often better than *right* now.
If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea.
If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.
Namespaces are one honking great idea -- let's do more of those!
```
###Trying running " import this" in your python interpreter.

Fun fact, i hate going through video tutorials, everything tutorial that involves me watching videos.
Reading books is one of the best ways to improve your craftsmanship and to become a better software engineer. This is a continuously updated list with my favourite programming books, sorted by topic. I link to the ebook version where possible but most books should be available made from dead trees as well.

Architecture & System Design
How to build reliable software that works well.

   •	Release It! by Michael T. Nygard
   •	The Architecture of Open Source Applications by Amy Brown
   •	The Architecture of Open Source Applications, Volume II by Amy Brown
   •	The Performance of Open Source Applications by Tavish Armstrong

Craftsmanship
Books about best practices, code quality and professionalism. Every single one of these books is fantastic and I got so much out of them. If you don’t know which area to focus on first then start here.

   •	Clean Code by Robert C. Martin
   •	Team Geek by Brian W. Fitzpatrick
   •	The Clean Coder by Robert C. Martin
   •	The Passionate Programmer by Chad Fowler
   •	The Zen Programmer by Christian Grobmeier
   •	HBR’s 10 Must Reads on Managing Yourself
   •	Better: A surgeon’s notes on performance by Atul Gawande
   •	Code Complete by Steve McConnell

Programming Languages
Books about specific programming languages that I enjoyed. There’s often free resources available online but sometimes it’s nice to just buy a book that takes you through many aspects of a language. Some of these books are great reads even if you’re not interested in the language specifically, as they teach you important universal concepts.

   JavaScript
   • Effective JavaScript by David Herman
   •	JavaScript: The Good Parts by Douglas Crockford
   Python
   •	Writing Idiomatic Python by Jeff Knupp
   •	Effective Python by Bret Slatkin
   •	Python Cookbook, 3rd Ed. by David Beazley and Brian Jones
   •	Two Scoops of Django by Daniel and Audrey Roy Greenfeld
   •	Fluent Python by Luciano Ramalho
   •	Automate the Boring Stuff with Python by Al Sweigart

CompSci fundamentals, algorithms, and math
This stuff is important. Languages and frameworks come and go but the foundations remain largely static. Re-visit these every once in a while.
   •	The Algorithm Design Manual by Steven S. Skiena
   •	Algorithms by Dasgupta, Papadimitriou, and Vazirani
   •	Introduction to Algorithms by Thomas H. Cormen
   •	Concrete Mathematics by Ronald L. Graham
   

Postmortems
The best software engineering war stories around. Get inspired by reading about successful or failed software projects that others have worked on. These books let you learn from the experiences and careers of some of the best people in the field.

   •	Coders at Work by Peter Seibel
   •	FoxTales by Kerry Nietz
   •	Masters of Doom by David Kushner
   •	Postmortems from Game Developer by Austin Grossman
   •	Showstopper by G. Pascal Zachary
   •	The Future Was Here: The Commodore Amiga by Jimmy Maher
   •	The Making of Karateka by Jordan Mechner
   •	The Making of Prince of Persia by Jordan Mechner
