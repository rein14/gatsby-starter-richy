Fun fact, i hate going through video tutorials, everything tutorial that involves me watching videos.
Reading books is one of the best ways to improve your craftsmanship and to become a better software engineer. This is a continuously updated list with my favourite programming books, sorted by topic. I link to the ebook version where possible but most books should be available made from dead trees as well.

Architecture & System Design
How to build reliable software that works well.
```javascript
const foo = bar
console.log(foo);
```
```
   •	Release It! by Michael T. Nygard
   •	The Architecture of Open Source Applications by Amy Brown
   •	The Architecture of Open Source Applications, Volume II by Amy Brown
   •	The Performance of Open Source Applications by Tavish Armstrong
```
Craftsmanship
Books about best practices, code quality and professionalism. Every single one of these books is fantastic and I got so much out of them. If you don’t know which area to focus on first then start here.
```
   •	Clean Code by Robert C. Martin
   •	Team Geek by Brian W. Fitzpatrick
   •	The Clean Coder by Robert C. Martin
   •	The Passionate Programmer by Chad Fowler
   •	The Zen Programmer by Christian Grobmeier
   •	HBR’s 10 Must Reads on Managing Yourself
   •	Better: A surgeon’s notes on performance by Atul Gawande
   •	Code Complete by Steve McConnell
```
Programming Languages
Books about specific programming languages that I enjoyed. There’s often free resources available online but sometimes it’s nice to just buy a book that takes you through many aspects of a language. Some of these books are great reads even if you’re not interested in the language specifically, as they teach you important universal concepts.

   JavaScript
   ```
   • Effective JavaScript by David Herman
   •	JavaScript: The Good Parts by Douglas Crockford
   ```
   Python
   ```
   •	Writing Idiomatic Python by Jeff Knupp
   •	Effective Python by Bret Slatkin
   •	Python Cookbook, 3rd Ed. by David Beazley and Brian Jones
   •	Two Scoops of Django by Daniel and Audrey Roy Greenfeld
   •	Fluent Python by Luciano Ramalho
   •	Automate the Boring Stuff with Python by Al Sweigart
   •  Dan-Bader-Python-Tricks_-A-Buffet-of-Awesome-Python-Features-Dan-Bader-2017
   •  Data Science in python

   ```
CompSci fundamentals, algorithms, and math
This stuff is important. Languages and frameworks come and go but the foundations remain largely static. Re-visit these every once in a while.
   ```
   •	The Algorithm Design Manual by Steven S. Skiena
   •	Algorithms by Dasgupta, Papadimitriou, and Vazirani
   •	Introduction to Algorithms by Thomas H. Cormen
   •	Concrete Mathematics by Ronald L. Graham
   ```

Postmortems
The best software engineering war stories around. Get inspired by reading about successful or failed software projects that others have worked on. These books let you learn from the experiences and careers of some of the best people in the field.
   ```
   •	Coders at Work by Peter Seibel
   •	FoxTales by Kerry Nietz
   •	Masters of Doom by David Kushner
   •	Postmortems from Game Developer by Austin Grossman
   •	Showstopper by G. Pascal Zachary
