There are moments you feel so lost you don’t exactly know how to turn things around.

That feeling;

I don’t want code this 

I don’t have a fix for this

Oh, But I fixed it

These are the kind of moments that make you doubt your credibility as a programmer. You struggle to recognize your value, and negatively compare your skills against the skills of others. It’s normal that these things happen. It’s also normal that you recognize all these patterns and generate a fix for it all.
It isn’t surprising that you feel lost. Early in the process of learning anything, it is a pretty normal thing unless it is similar enough to something else you’ve done before, and then it becomes easier.
In the software space we are constantly learning new things, developing new ideas, refactoring algorithm, etc. So you see, it’s pretty normal for you to get lost sometimes, but the question is “how you make a comeback”.

I personally believe the most brilliant people out there are the ones that know exactly where and how to find relevant data and use them to their advantage. I’d much rather work with a programmer who can figure out how to do something quickly than someone who knows X, Y, and Z forwards and backwards, but who has no idea how to do A, B, and C, and can’t learn them when needed. The former will be able to get the current job done and then move on to the next one. The latter might get the current job done faster, but then they’ll be useless when faced with something new.
Google it! Googling things: actually, this is something all programmers do. We don’t know everything, we can’t remember everything we’ve already done, and sometimes there are new ways of doing things we’ve done previously. I’d be more worried about you if you weren’t looking up things when you were unsure of yourself.

Programming can be frustrating. Documentation can be missing, misleading, or useless. Libraries can have weird restrictions, can fail to work as expected. You can make typos that cause the code to do the wrong thing because it is using the wrong variable. You might spend days looking for a bug in your code, only to discover that it is actually a problem in someone else’s code and that person refuses to acknowledge it or fix it.

Take breaks. Work on another project for a while or, if you can, go do something completely different; read a book, play a sport, take a walk, ask questions, travel maybe; go to a completely different location, see if it works.

Sometimes all it takes is explaining what you are trying to do to someone else. You would be surprised the kind of feedbacks you’d get in return.

Frustration is normal, taking breaks from projects that infuriate you is normal.

Giving up the project entirely is the only way to “lose.”
